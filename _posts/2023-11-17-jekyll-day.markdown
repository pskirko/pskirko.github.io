This morning, I finished the first project in Wes Bos's "Javascript 30" course, a simple drum kit.
It was straightforward but since I've never done intensive frontend web programming, I always learn
a new thing or two even with simple but well-chosen examples. For example, this project introduced
me to the "endtransition" event; hadn't used that before.

I want to make an embeddable version of the drum kit, and just embed it in an upcoming post. Javascript
is great because, as the web's native language, you can almost always show, rather than tell.

After work, I set up my Jekyll site for GitHub Pages. So not much coding to report on today.
