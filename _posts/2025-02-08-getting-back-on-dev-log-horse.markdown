Ok, yea, so it's been a while since I've blogged here. My last post here was from last July, so it's
been 7 months. And even that post was a one-off. Big sigh.

Blogging consistently has always been difficult for me. But hey, gotta get back on the horse, as
they say. Not to make excuses, but there were two extenuating factors last year:

 * Purchasing a condo and moving from Bellevue to Shoreline
 * Changing jobs, which kicked off the whole time-intensive "interview prep" effort

Anyways. I'd say my goal right now is to consistently find about 4 hours each week where I can just
focus on pure, simple acts of programming, so that I stay in touch and connected to the
fundamentals of programming. As I mentioned before ([prev post]({% link _posts/2023-11-14-hello-dev-log.markdown %})),
fluency is the goal, but staying in touch with programming is on the path to that goal.

Previously, I was focusing on JavaScript, but for now I've switched back to Java. Why? Ultimately,
it's about my programming history. I've just spent more time in Java and Java-like languages such
as C#, so it just feels more natural and "at home" to be working in Java. With JavaScript, I haven't done as
much programming there, so the number of hours I would need to feel "at home" there probably
exceeds what I can muster up time-wise.

Of course, that is just a soft constraint. Ultimately, if I'm investigating something native to another
language, I'll just use that language. But Java is just like "home base" for general concepts.

Anyways, just these meta topics for today. Hopefully back to some code results in the next few days.
